# Iris-Flower-Classification ðŸŒ¸
The Iris Flower Classification project is a machine learning application designed to classify iris flowers into one of three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. This is achieved using features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The project demonstrates the application of supervised learning techniques to solve a classic classification problem.

# Project Overview
The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning, first introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. It serves as a standard dataset for testing machine learning algorithms due to its simplicity and well-structured data.

This project aims to:

1. Explore and visualize the Iris dataset.

2. Implement and evaluate various classification algorithms.

3. Develop an easy-to-use model for classifying iris flower species based on input features.

# Features
Data Analysis and Visualization : Includes descriptive statistics, correlation heatmaps, and pair plots for understanding data patterns.

It Utilizes machine learning algorithms such as:

1. Logistic Regression

2. Decision Trees

3. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

5. Random Forest

Model Evaluation : Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to compare the performance of models.
Interactive Predictions: A script or web interface allows users to input features and get real-time predictions of flower species.
